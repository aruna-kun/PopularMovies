# PopularMovies
MyPopularMovies is a project that allows users to discover most popular movies playing out there and also allow users to sorty by top rated.


Note:
------
You need to create a free account on themoviedb.org and generate your personal API key from themoviedb.org. If you donâ€™t already have an
account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for 
educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your 
request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

Once you obtain your key, in the Constants file under com.udacity.aruna.mypopularmovies package replace "----generated_api_key----" with 
your generated key.
public final static String KEY_VALUE = "----generated_api_key----"; //Need to be updated with the key from moviedbapi.
